# 📊 Job Application Tracker

## 🚀 Welcome, Job Warrior!

Job hunting can feel like a full-time job in itself. Keeping track of all your applications, follow-ups, and interview schedules can quickly turn into a chaotic mess. But fear not! This **Job Application Tracker** is here to bring order to the madness. 🎯

With this **Streamlit-powered** and **SQLite-backed** tracker, you'll never again forget when to follow up, who ghosted you, or where you *accidentally* applied twice. 😉

## 🔧 Features

✅ **Add New Job Applications** – Store company names, job titles, application dates, and recruiter contacts, so you always know who to ~annoy~ professionally follow up with.  
✅ **View & Update Applications** – Keep your job hunt organized with real-time updates on your application statuses. From "Applied" to "Ghosted" (we’ve all been there 😭).  
✅ **Set Follow-up & Interview Dates** – Never miss an interview or a chance to bug a recruiter at the right time!  
✅ **Priority Tagging** – Mark your applications as High, Medium, or Low priority, because let's be honest, not all jobs are created equal.  
✅ **Analytics Dashboard** – Get insights on your job hunt, including how many interviews you've landed (or how many rejections you've survived 💀).
